### ✨ Features
- Accepts two integer inputs from the user
- Supports four basic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- Uses a `switch` statement to handle operator logic

- Handles invalid operator input gracefully

### 📋 How to Use
1. Run the program.
2. Enter two numbers when prompted.
3. Choose an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).
4. View the result of the operation.

### 🚀 Getting Started
